# Travel-Suggestor-MiniZinc
The Gecode 6.1.1 solver is used in this problem. This project gives a travel plan within budget and time limit.

# Version 1
There is a list of Places you can visit. To explore each place properly, there is a time limit and cost to be spent. Every place has a satisfaction point. The goal is to maximise the satisfaction while staying within the limitations of travel time and budget the traveller has.

# Version 2
Addition of the constraints that certain places cannot be visited on the same day.
# Version 3
There is a list of hotels to visit. Each hotel has its cost. Given the constraint of your budget you can choose which hotels you can stay in.
